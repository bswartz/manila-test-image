This project contains scripts and configs to create a small bootable
Linux image, primarily for the purposes of testing Manila.

It uses buildroot to do nearly all of the hard work.

The built Linux image is optimized for size, and targets the i386
platform under QEMU.

The following extra features are enabled:
* SSH server
* NFSv3/4 server
* NFSv3/4 client
* Samba4 Server
* CIFS client

== Dependencies needed to build ==

On Ubuntu:

 sudo apt-get -y install bison flex texinfo gettext ncurses-dev unzip \
     sshpass quilt qt-sdk qemu-kvm build-essential gcc-multilib

On Fedora:

 sudo dnf -y install bison flex texinfo gettext ncurses-devel unzip \
     sshpass quilt qt-devel qemu-kvm gcc-c++ make glibc-devel.i686

== Building the images ==

To build both images run:

 ./run-buildroot.sh

== Cleaning up ==

To nuke everything and start over:

 rm -rf buildroot output* overlay*
 sudo rm *.qcow2

== Detailed Docs ==

More detailed docs are available:

* doc/building.txt - individual build steps
* doc/configuring.txt - how to change the config
* doc/testing.txt - how to test the images
