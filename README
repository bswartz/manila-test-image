This project contains scripts and configs to create a small bootable
Linux image, primarily for the purposes of testing Manila.

It uses buildroot to do nearly all of the hard work.

The built Linux image is optimized for size, and targets the i386
platform under QEMU.

The following extra features are enabled:
* SSH server
* NFSv3/4 server
* NFSv3/4 client
* Samba4 Server
* CIFS client

== Dependencies needed ==

On Ubuntu:

 # To build
 sudo apt-get -y install curl unzip bc python quilt parted qemu-utils \
     build-essential gcc-multilib
 # For test/dev
 sudo apt-get -y install bison flex texinfo gettext ncurses-dev sshpass \
     qt-sdk qemu-kvm

On Fedora:

 # To build
 sudo dnf -y install curl unzip bc python quilt parted qemu-img gcc-c++ \
     make glibc-devel.i686
 # For test/dev
 sudo dnf -y install bison flex texinfo gettext ncurses-devel sshpass \
     qt-devel qemu-kvm

== Building the images ==

To build both images run:

 ./run-buildroot.sh

== Cleaning up ==

To nuke everything and start over:

 rm -rf buildroot output* overlay*
 sudo rm *.qcow2

== Detailed Docs ==

More detailed docs are available:

* doc/building.txt - individual build steps
* doc/configuring.txt - how to change the config
* doc/testing.txt - how to test the images
