== Initial setup ==

There are several one time steps that need to be done after cloning a
new repo. These are all handled by running:

 ./init-buildroot.sh

== Building ==

It's best to look at what run-buildroot.sh does, but the basic flow
for building an image is:

Create the overlay (for the client image):

 mkdir overlay-client
 cp -a common-files/* overlay-client

Copy the defconfig and create an output directory (for the client
image, for example):

 cp conf/buildroot-client.config buildroot/configs/manila_client_defconfig
 ( cd buildroot ; make O=../output-client manila_client_defconfig )
 rm buildroot/configs/manila_client_defconfig

Then invoke make in the appropriate directory:

 ( cd buildroot ; make O=../output-client all )

== Creating the qcow2 image ==

After buildroot succeeds, create the qcow2 file (for the client image,
for example):

 ./make-bootable-disk.sh client

== Cleaning ==

To do a simple clean after changing some config options (for the client
image, for example):

 cd buildroot
 make O=../output-client clean
